        <h1>EVIDENCE & PROOF</h1>
        
        <p>I'm speaking with evidence and proof (such as screenshots and screenrecordings). You can check WALL-E's message history or stay alert next time he joins. He's straight up a racist, anti-Islamic, pedophile American who only chats up female players that are sadly minors. You'll see how creepy and predatory his vibe is, dropping those "" emojis after some lame-ass joke to a underage girl, just waiting for her to lol. He's always lurking on the islands with minor girls, only talking to them, and straight insulting players on his "hate list" you know, specific nations and Muslims, obviously.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Wall-E aint no better than Epstein, the only diff is Jeffrey had stacks of cash, private islands, and elite plugs while Wall-E's got global access to underage girls.</li>
            <li>And Epstein wasnt even racist from what we know, also he was out there touching grass unlike Wall-E. Glued to his fatass fantasizing about groping those female players in the servers he mods... how pathetic.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>AND based on TELESIGHT's so called 'strict server rules' his own clown mod WALL-E is straight up dodging the harshest ones TELESIGHT's been shoving down throats for YEARS. What a hypocrite ass move.</p>
